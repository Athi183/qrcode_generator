### **QR Code Generator: Bringing Links to Life!**
Dive into the fascinating world of QR codes with this captivating Python project! ðŸŒ€ 

This application transforms any link into a visually stunning and functional QR code, leading you seamlessly to the right destination. With just a few lines of code, I turned an everyday task into a magical, creative experience. ðŸŒˆâœ¨ 

This project was not just a technical endeavor but a fun and intriguing exploration of how art, technology, and functionality come together. Whether you're sharing a webpage, a favorite video, or a secret message, this QR code generator adds a splash of creativity to every link! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ”—

As part of the project, I followed best practices by creating a virtual environment using the command (In windows):
```bash
python -m venv venv


python -m: The -m flag tells Python to run a module as a script. In this case, the venv module is being run to create a virtual environment.
venv (module): It is a built-in module in Python (starting from version 3.3) that provides the ability to create isolated environments for projects.
venv (name): The second venv in the command is simply the name of the virtual environment directory you want to create. By convention, many developers use venv as its name.

Then we should activate the venv module using the command
```bash
venv\Scripts\activated
To deactivate it, use the command
```bash
deactivated

Now we can install the qrcode by using the command
```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]
The [pil] part ensures that the library uses the Pillow library for image generation, which is recommended for creating QR codes.
