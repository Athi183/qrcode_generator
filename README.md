## **Setting Up the Project**  

To ensure a clean and isolated environment for this project, I followed best practices by creating a virtual environment.  

### 1. **Create a Virtual Environment**  
Run the following command (Windows):  
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Hereâ€™s what the command does:  
- **`python -m`**: The `-m` flag tells Python to run a module as a script. In this case, the `venv` module is being run to create a virtual environment.  
- **`venv` (module)**: A built-in module in Python (starting from version 3.3) that provides the ability to create isolated environments for projects.  
- **`venv` (name)**: The second `venv` is the name of the virtual environment directory. By convention, many developers use `venv` as its name, but you can choose any name.  

### 2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**  
To activate the virtual environment, use the command:  
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```  
When the virtual environment is active, you'll see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt.  

To deactivate the environment when you're done, use the command:  
```bash
deactivate
```

### 3. **Install the Required Library**  
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the `qrcode` library using:  
```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]
```  
- The `[pil]` part ensures that the library uses the Pillow library for image generation, which is recommended for creating QR codes.
