## **Setting Up the Project**  

To ensure a clean and isolated environment for this project, I followed best practices by creating a virtual environment.  

### 1. **Create a Virtual Environment**  
Run the following command (Windows):  
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Hereâ€™s what the command does:  
- **`python -m`**: The `-m` flag tells Python to run a module as a script. In this case, the `venv` module is being run to create a virtual environment.  
- **`venv` (module)**: A built-in module in Python (starting from version 3.3) that provides the ability to create isolated environments for projects.  
- **`venv` (name)**: The second `venv` is the name of the virtual environment directory. By convention, many developers use `venv` as its name, but you can choose any name.  

### 2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**  
To activate the virtual environment, use the command:  
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```  
When the virtual environment is active, you'll see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt.  

To deactivate the environment when you're done, use the command:  
```bash
deactivate
```

### 3. **Install the Required Library**  
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the `qrcode` library using:  
```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]
```  
- The `[pil]` part ensures that the library uses the Pillow library for image generation, which is recommended for creating QR codes.

## **QR Code Generator: Key Features and Steps**  

1. **Input Handling**:  
   - The program prompts the user to input a URL (`data`) for which the QR code needs to be generated.  
   - It also asks for a filename to save the QR code image.  
   - Both inputs are cleaned using `.strip()` to remove any extra white spaces for better accuracy and usability.  

2. **QR Code Customization**:  
   - A `QRCode` object is created using the `qrcode` library, with customizable attributes like:
     - **`box_size`**: Determines the size of each individual square in the QR code grid.  
     - **`border`**: Sets the thickness of the QR code border (in grid units).  

3. **Adding Data to the QR Code**:  
   - The user-provided URL is added to the QR code object using the `add_data` method.  

4. **Image Customization**:  
   - The QR code is rendered into an image with custom colors:  
     - **`fill_color='blue'`**: Sets the color of the QR code squares.  
     - **`back_color='white'`**: Sets the background color of the QR code.  

5. **Saving the QR Code**:  
   - The generated QR code image is saved to a file using the `save` method. The filename is specified by the user, allowing flexibility in file naming.  

6. **User Feedback**:  
   - The program confirms the successful creation and saving of the QR code by displaying a message with the file name.

### **Why This Project Stands Out**  
- **Dynamic Inputs**: Accepts user inputs to create personalized QR codes.  
- **Customization**: Offers the ability to change QR code colors and adjust the size and border.  
- **Practical Utility**: Creates valid QR codes that can be used for URLs, messages, or other data.  
- **Enhanced Usability**: Ensures clean inputs and provides confirmation for a seamless user experience.
